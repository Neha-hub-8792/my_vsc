        <h1>My First VSC</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
        <h3>About Console</h3>
        <p>The console. log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.</p>
       <script>
           var first_name = "Ranbir";
           console.log(first_name);
           var last_name = "Kapoor";
           console.log(last_name);
           var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
           console.log(full_name);
           var number_1 = 5;
           console.log(number_1);
           var number_2 = 10;
           console.log(number_2);
           var add = number_1 + number_2;
           console.log(add);
           var multiply = number_1 * number_2;
           console.log(multiply);
           var divide = number_2/number_1;
           console.log(divide);
           var power = Math.pow(4,2);
           console.log(power);
